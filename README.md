32x32 Falling Block Game

A 32×32 grid-based falling block game built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is inspired by classic Nokia and Tetris-style mechanics, featuring dynamic multi-size pieces, automatic falling behavior, row-clearing logic, score tracking, and persistent high score storage.
